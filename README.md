Business Analysis of Hotel Bookings
================

<br>

### Introduction:

The scope of this project was to analyze booking data for two hotels
located in Portugal. One hotel is a City Hotel and the other is a Resort
Hotel.

**Data Source:** Hotel Booking Demand dataset on
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand).

**Business Problem:** Canceled bookings result in a loss of revenue for
the hotels and the hotels would like to reduce the number of canceled
bookings.

The first goal of this project was to provide insights about how
different variables affected cancellation status. These insights can be
used by the hotels to guide business strategy. Trends in booking data
were also analyzed to aid with demand forecasting.

The second goal was to use machine learning to develop a tool that can
be used for estimating the number of canceled bookings, in order to
support the hotels when calculating revenue projections.

##### The project was done using R and it consisted of two parts:

- **Part 1:** An Exploratory Data Analysis was performed in order to
  gain insights to support hotel management with operations and demand
  forecasting decisions. An overview of booking results was also
  presented.

- **Part 2:** The Random Forest machine learning algorithm was used to
  predict cancellation status, indicating if a booking was canceled or
  not canceled. Several Random Forest machine learning models were built
  and compared, in order to evaluate which model was to be selected in
  providing estimates to support the hotels when calculating revenue
  projections.
